Description: 
    Using forward-pipe operator, %>%, is extremely useful both reading
    and writing code-flows, but debugging and understanding deeply
    nested pipes are bit difficult due to magrittr's complicated 
    mechanism. This package convert %>% syntax to eager evaluation and
    you can easily understand meaning of codes.
